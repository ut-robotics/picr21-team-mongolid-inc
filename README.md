*Virco:* Installed the OS and did the inital setup. There was a problem with the first install, ssh couldnâ€™t be setup properly. A fresh new install fixed everything. (2h)
*Karl:* Helped with the inital setup and prepeared the electronic components for the testrobot. Baptised the robot and gave it the proper christian name of Valdis (3h)
*Markus:* With Virco setup a ssh connection over Visual Studio Code.
